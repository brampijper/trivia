# Trivia Questions App
This project is part of my deepdive in React.js.
Built to gain more knowledge in:
- Thinking in react
- Composability
- State and data structures.

The goal off the app is to fetch trivia data from the "opentdb.com" api.
Let the user answer a bunch of questions about random topics and return the quiz result.
This project is ongoing and I will add extra features whenever I come up with them.
